The creation of the Pepactive Finder database addresses this need by compiling peptide sequences associated with immune receptors involved in cancer immunotherapy. The study's methodology involves the collection of secondary data on peptide sequences, which are then integrated into a unified database using Apache, MySQL, and the Django framework with Python for effective data management. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools such as BLAST, Protparam, and PDB Builder are integrated into the database to enhance its analytical capabilities. Additionally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed and trained on pre-processed peptide sequence data to predict bioactivity, optimizing parameters for accuracy
